Version 1.0

Windomize makes (groups of) divs draggable and resizable, whose contents can be toggled (smoothly animated).

Windomize manages the state of each div - open, closed, hover, focus. The corresponding styling for each state is fully customizable through jquery.windomize.css.

Demo included; Example.html.
